        <h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Kobe Bryant's life:</h2>
        <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify">
          <br />
          <li><b>1978</b> Born in Philadelphia.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1997</b> - In his rookie season, Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest
            at NBA All-Star Weekend, becoming the youngest player in NBA history
            to ever do so. In Game 5 of the second round of the playoffs against
            the Utah Jazz, he infamously shot four airballs as the Lakers were
            eliminated. He was named to the All-Rookie second team after his
            first campaign.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>1998</b> - Made first of his 18 All-Star appearances, which
            included 17 straight from 2000-16. The Lakers lost to the Jazz in
            the Western Conference Finals that season.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2000</b> - Won his first of five NBA championships (2000-02,
            2009-10). That season, he also made the first of his nine All-NBA
            Defensive first teams.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2002</b> - Named to first of 11 All-NBA first teams, which is
            tied for the most in NBA history with Karl Malone and LeBron James.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2003</b> - Arrested in Eagle, Colorado, as part of an
            investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old
            hotel employee. The charges were dropped 14 months later and after
            his accuser filed a civil suit, they reached a settlement.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2006</b> - Scored 81 points in a game against the Toronto
            Raptors, which is the second-most points scored in a game in NBA
            history.

          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2009</b> - Won his first NBA Finals MVP award before winning it
            again in 2010. The Lakers beat the Jazz in the playoffs in both
            seasons.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2016</b> - In his final NBA game, Bryant put forth a vintage
            performance, scoring 60 points against the Jazz in a 101-96 Lakers
            win, becoming the oldest player in NBA history to score 60 in a
            game. That is also the most points any NBA player has ever scored in
            his final game. He finished his career with 33,643 points, which was
            third in NBA history until James surpassed the mark on Jan. 25,
            2020. He had played his final game in Salt Lake City a few weeks
            prior, where the Jazz played a tribute video to honor him.

          <li>
            <b>2005</b> - Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first
            iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007.
            The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out
            of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it
            "Invention of the Year" for 2007.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>2020</b> - Died in a helicopter crash along with eight others,
            including his daughter Gianna, in California at the age of 41.

            >I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I
            have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back
            hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to
            chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also
            don't capitulate to it. You embrace it.</i
